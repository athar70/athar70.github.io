I am Athar Mahmoudi, a Machine Learning Scientist at [Advanced Sensor Research Inc. (ASR)](https://advancedsensorresearch.ca/), where we are revolutionizing glucose monitoring using breakthrough technologies. Our approach leverages non-invasive sensors coupled with advanced machine learning techniques, including cutting-edge Transformer models.

I earned my Ph.D. in Computing Science from the University of Alberta in January 2025, where I had the privilege of working under the guidance of [Dr. Matthew Guzdial](https://www.amii.ca/about/our-people/matthew-guzdial/)  and [Prof. Pierre Boulanger](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~pierreb/).

My Ph.D. research explores the exciting intersections of Reinforcement Learning and personalized virtual reality experiences. 

I am passionate about leveraging these technologies to create innovative solutions that meaningfully enhance user interaction, deepen engagement, and promote greater awareness.
