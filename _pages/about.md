I am Athar Mahmoudi, a PhD candidate in Computing Science at the University of Alberta, where I have the privilege of working under the guidance of [Dr. Matthew Guzdial](https://www.amii.ca/about/our-people/matthew-guzdial/) and [Prof. Pierre Boulanger](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~pierreb/).

My research explores the exciting intersections of Reinforcement Learning and personalized virtual reality experiences. I'm passionate about using these technologies to create innovative solutions that enhance user interaction and engagement in immersive environments.
