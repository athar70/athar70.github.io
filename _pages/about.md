I am a Machine Learning Scientist specializing in **deep learning** and statistical methods for physiological time-series analysis. Currently, I lead research on non-invasive glucose estimation at [Advanced Sensor Research Inc. (ASR)](https://advancedsensorresearch.ca/), developing **Transformer-based architectures** and **representation learning** pipelines for noisy, real-world data.

I hold a Ph.D. in Computing Science from the University of Alberta, where I focused on **Reinforcement Learning** and **Human-Centered AI** under the guidance of [Dr. Matthew Guzdial](https://www.amii.ca/about/our-people/matthew-guzdial/) and [Prof. Pierre Boulanger](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~pierreb/).

My research philosophy bridges the gap between theoretical novelty and deployment: I focus on building robust, interpretable models that generalize across domains (people and sensors) and withstand the uncertainty of applied settings. My technical core lies in **sequence modeling**, **domain generalization**, and rigorous **experimental evaluation** to support data-driven decision-making.
