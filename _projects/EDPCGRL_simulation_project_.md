## Overview

**EDPCGRL SpiderVR in Simulation** extends our work in personalized virtual reality exposure therapy for arachnophobia. Using **Experience-Driven Procedural Content Generation via Reinforcement Learning (EDPCGRL)**, the system adapts virtual spiders to match the stress responses of **simulated virtual humans**. This allows the system to personalize the experience based on physiological measures, without requiring therapist intervention.

The framework is tested in a simulated environment where virtual humans, based on prior psychological research on arachnophobia, respond to the spiderâ€™s attributes such as size, movement, and proximity. The goal is to automatically adjust these attributes in real-time to achieve the desired stress level in each simulation, outperforming traditional content generation approaches.

## Key Features

- **Simulated Virtual Humans:** Virtual humans are used in the simulation, modeled on arachnophobia research, allowing for rapid testing and adaptation of the therapy system without direct human trials.
- **Multiple Optimization Methods:** Users can configure the simulation to run various optimization algorithms, including Random, Greedy, Genetic Algorithms (GA), Q-Learning, and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DQN, PPO, A2C).

- **Parameter Configuration:** The system allows flexible configuration of initial state (`StartState`) and target stress levels (`TargetStress`), enabling fine control over the simulated therapy.

## Human Study Simulation

In this simulation-based evaluation, **EDPCGRL SpiderVR** demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional search-based methods. The reinforcement learning system adapted more quickly to virtual human responses, presenting fewer spiders to achieve the desired stress levels with high accuracy.
